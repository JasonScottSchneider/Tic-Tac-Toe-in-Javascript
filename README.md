# Tic-Tac-Toe-in-Javascript
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game set for one human player against a computer player. 

It has a Star Wars theme, so that is the purpose of the background image. I would upload the image as a jpg, but Github likes images to be archived in a zip or other archived format, not an image bare by itself.

So far, it works well as it should in Google Chrome, but I haven't done anything in the code to make it work in Firefox. It will work in Firefox, but the CSS is goofy in Firefox. Use Chrome to play Tic Tac Toe for now.
